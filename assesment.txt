//Question 1
/*In order to figure out how to determine if there is overlap between two times,
we need to compare the StartTime with the Endtime for Roster 1 and Roster 2.
For this exercise I am assuming different department does not impact time overlap and there is overlap if an 
employee 1 ends at the same time an employee 2 starts (ends at 9:00am -start at (9:00am)is overlap)*/

    Employee: 1,

      EndTime: 1508479360,
    };
  /*checked if the start time is not over end time for each employee and also if there is overlap 
  comparing start time with end time of two employees.  Unix timestamps are displayed in seconds so if a number is higher then the time is later 
  therefore we can compare times by seeing if end time of employee1 is greater than start time of employee2.*/

  //Question 1 continued
  /*The instructions for this exercise was to compare 2 employees.
  If there was a larger data set to compare multiple employees I would loop through the array of data and push the times to two arrays: start times and end times.
  Then I would compare the two arrays by looping through and find if start time of i+1 of start array is less than or equal to i of end time array 
  to determine an error.
